It was designed as a functional demonstration of a modern e-commerce site, with a responsive user interface and efficient server-side data management.

After analyzing the game rules and modeling the project in UML, we developed a first playable console version, with tests. A second graphical version was then created with Qt, which we learned on the fly. Documentation was generated with Doxygen, and a comprehensive report was written in LaTeX."

It allows users to visualize Brussels metro lines, find the fastest route between two stops using Dijkstra's algorithm, and manage favorite trips (add, rename, delete). Users can also search for a favorite to save time without having to reconfigure a route each time."

If a date is specified, a calendar view allows efficient visualization of deadlines.<br><br> The backend relies on Firebase (authentication, database and real-time synchronization), enabling seamless integration with the mobile environment. Emphasis was placed on data persistence, user session management, local caching to improve startup performance, and resilience to state changes (e.g., screen rotation, connection loss).<br><br> While the UI/UX could be improved, the main objective of the project was to ensure backend reliability, data security and application robustness in terms of logic and lifecycle."
