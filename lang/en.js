Emphasis was placed on data persistence, user session management, local caching to improve startup performance, and resilience to state changes (e.g., screen rotation, connection loss).<br><br> While the UI/UX could be improved, the main objective of the project was to ensure backend reliability, data security and application robustness in terms of logic and lifecycle.",
